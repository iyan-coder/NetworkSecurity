"""
setup.py is the traditional file used in Python packaging.

It defines metadata about the project (name, version, author, etc.)
and installation behavior (e.g., dependencies, included packages).

While modern projects use pyproject.toml, many existing tools and CI/CD
pipelines still support or require setup.py â€” so it's still seen in practice.
